This is the default directory for relevant client data.
You can either place the "game_pak" file of the wanted target client here, 
or unpack it here so the server can use it's data.
For example, this is required to load movement data of public transportations.

If you would like to use data from another location, you can edit Configurations/ClientData.json to edit the location, 
or add multiple sources. They will be used checked in the provided order and can, be mixed which might be useful when
developing custom content.
