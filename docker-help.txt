Support for docker was added with PR 267 on 2021-05-27 by alex-marchenko
https://github.com/AAEmu/AAEmu/pull/267

Shellscripts you can use:
--------------------------
start.sh builds docker images for AAEmu.Login and AAEmu.Game and starts them along with db container. Building machine requires only docker and docker-compose

stop.sh shuts down and removes all containers leaving only docker volume with db

stop-reset-db.sh shuts down and removes all containers WITH db volume

clear-caches.sh convenience script, removes all cached intermediate docker images, might be useful if you're building a lot
