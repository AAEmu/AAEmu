## Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the AAEmu project both as an experienced developer or as an enthusiast player wanting to spin up your own private server to play with friends.

### Understanding AAEmu Components

Its important to understand AAEmu compontents to be able to setup your own server and start playing with it and contribute to the project.

#### Database Components

##### Archeage Reference Database (Sqlite - ReadOnly)

This is the original Archeage database, contains the majority of references, loot tables, configurations related to the all components in the Archeage world. This database is readonly and is used to read all the original game data and start the server on its initial state.

##### Archeage State Database (MySQL - Read/Write)

This is the database that contains all the state changes made in Archeage world.

Support changes like:

-   Player Characters (Level, Skills, Experience, Quests, Labor points, etc)
-   Housing information
-   Items acquired (Inventory, Bank, etc)

This database is composes of two schemas:

1. `aaemu_game`: All the state changes made to the Archeage world,
1. `aaemu_login`: All data related to login/account of the players.

#### Application Components

##### Login Server

This is the server that handles the login process from both archeage clients and game server.

This server uses the `Archeage State Database` to check the account and load characters information to be used by the Game Client in the login process.

##### Game Server

This is the main application of the project and that handles all ingame server process.

This server uses both `Archeage References Database` and `Archeage State Database` to be loaded and keeping the state of the world.

##### Game Launcher

This is an application that start the Archeage Client targeting the specific Emulated Login Server.

##### Archeage Client

This is the Archeage Game Client used to play and connect to the **AAEmu**lated Game Server.

**Version 1.2** is the version of the client this project is mainly designed to work for,
**Other versions have varying, but generally less, support**

### Setup

#### Setup MySQL - Archeage State Database

1. Open MySQL Workbench (Which should have been included in the MySQL setup above) and create two schemas for AAEmu to use.
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-2.png)

1. Name these schemas `aaemu_game` and `aaemu_login`, your workbench should now look like this:
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-3.png)

1. After you have made both schemas, select the **aaemu_login** schema by double clicking it.
   You should see it become **bold** (Like the aaemu_game schema is the picture above) to indicate that it is selected.

1. Go to the location where you downloaded from the repository and enter into the `SQL` folder
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-4.png)

1. Drag **aaemu_login.sql** file into your MySQL workbench
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-5.png)

1. Click the lightning bolt icon over the text to run the commands.
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-6.png)

1. Select **aaemu_game** schema and repeat the process for **aaemu_game.sql** file.

1. Unsure you are still in the **aaemu_game** schema and enter into the `SQL/updates` folder

1. Drag and execute the each file in order starting from the oldest date to the newest.
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-7.png), this is needed to ensure the database state is up to date with the latest changes.

1. After you have generated your tables in this way, select the **aaemu_login** schema and open an sql tab if one isn‚Äôt already open using this icon.
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-8.png)

1. This first command will add a game server into the database, named AAemu.Game,running on your local IP on port 1239

    Enter the following command into the tab and execute it.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO `game_servers` (`id`, `name`, `host`, `port`, `hidden`) VALUES ('1', 'AAEmu.Game', '127.0.0.1', '1239', '0');
    ```

1. The second will create a login for you to use with the username and password as `test`.
   Enter the following command into the tab and execute it.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO `users` (`id`, `username`, `password`, `email`, `last_login`, `last_ip`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) VALUES (NULL, 'test', 'n4bQgYhMfWWaL+qgxVrQFaO/TxsrC4Is0V1sFbDwCgg=', '', '0', '', '0', '0');
    ```

1. Well done, you have now setup your MySQL database for AAEmu.

#### Game Server Configuration

1. **Build the project**. Open the command prompt in the location where you downloaded from the repository and run the following command:

    ```powershell
    dotnet build
    ```

    Result should be like below:
    ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-9.png)

1. Go to the location where you downloaded from the repository and enter into the `AAEmu.Game\bin\Debug\net6.0` folder

1. Find the `exampleconfig.json` file, rename it to `Config.json` and update its contents

    Change the values to fit your system.

    The file contents show look similar to the below. **Change the user and password info to what you setup in your MySQL installation.**

    ```json
    {
        "Id": 1,
        "AdditionalesId": [],
        "SecretKey": "test",
        "Network": {
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": 1239,
            "NumConnections": 10
        },
        "StreamNetwork": {
            "Host": "*",
            "Port": 1250
        },
        "LoginNetwork": {
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": "1234"
        },
        "Connections": {
            "MySQLProvider": {
                "Host": "localhost",
                "Port": "3306",
                "User": "change to your user name",
                "Password": "change to your user password",
                "Database": "aaemu_game"
            }
        },
        "CharacterNameRegex": "^[a-zA-Z0-9–∞-—è–ê-–Ø]{1,18}$",
        "MaxConcurencyThreadPool": 8,
        "HeightMapsEnable": false
    }
    ```

1. Find the file `AAEmu.Game\bin\Debug\net6.0\Configurations\ClientData.json` and open it

1. Locate the **root folder path** where you extracted the Archeage Client, copy the full path to the `game_pak` file (should be the biggest file in the folder)
   ![Alt text](images/getstarted-image-10.png)

1. Add the path as one of the `Source` options in the `ClientData.json` file like the following:
    ```
    {
        "ClientData": {
            "PreferClientHeightMap": true,
            "Sources": [
                "ClientData",
                "ClientData/game_pak",
                "C:/path/to/your/archeage/client/game_pak",
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

#### Login Server Configuration

1. Go to the location where you downloaded from the repository and enter into the `AAEmu.Login\bin\Debug\net6.0` folder

1. Find the `exampleconfig.json` file, rename it to `config.json` and update its contents

    Change the values to fit your system.

    The file contents show look similar to the below. **Change the user and password info to what you setup in your MySQL installation.**

    ```json
    {
        "SecretKey": "test",
        "AutoAccount": true,
        "InternalNetwork": {
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
