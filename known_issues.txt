 Currently known issue
-------------------------

- Placing backpacks on land that is rotated, does not properly place the pack. 
  This is a issue with Transform.Parent not calculating where the local space should go
  
- Not all skill types are implemented yet

- Not all quest types are implemented yet

- AI is only implemented in a very basic fashion

- Stats may not be 100% accurate to what the client reports yet, this is due to missing bonus stat implementations

- Boat physics are only working on a very basic level, collision does not really exist
  Boats will always be summoned at ocean level, this means that summoning in lakes or rivers will summon it under the ground!
  This is because of missing water container information on the server-side of things, same as object collisions
