 Currently known issue
-------------------------

- Not all skill types are implemented yet

- Not all quest types are implemented yet

- AI is only implemented in a very basic fashion

- Stats may not be 100% accurate to what the client reports yet, this is due to missing bonus stat implementations

- Placing plants, livestock or backpacks on land that is rotated, does not properly place the object. 
  This is a issue with Transform.Parent not calculating where the local space should go. 
  This is not a issue of the house isn't rotated. 

- Destroying a rotated house, will make all remaining objects that were not destroyed on it rotate in a wrong way

- Boat physics are only working on a very basic level, collision does not really exist
  Boats will always be summoned at ocean level, this means that summoning in lakes or rivers will summon it under the ground!
  This is because of missing water container information on the server-side of things, same as object collisions
  Also boats have a very minor stutter when they rotated at about 174.5° where they make a very slight "jump"
